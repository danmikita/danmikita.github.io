I gave a talk at the BarCampGR last weekend about automated deployments using git. The main idea of this talk was geared towards deployments using git tags specifically. Although it is relatively easy to set-up Heroku style deploys, it is less straight-forward how to deploy specific tags while still being able to roll-back to previous tags. 

Below you will find the Gist I wrote on the subject.
